### ⏣ About me
- 👩🏼‍🔬 I'm **Nessa Carson**, an automation, HTE, and synthesis/data chemist.
- 🔬 I work with **laboratory automation and data**, and my background is in **organic small molecule synthesis** and **homogeneous catalysis**.
- 🐱‍👤 I'm currently working in teams for several global projects for my company, including our **in-house eLN**, **workflows** for chemistry automation, and a transformed **data architecture** as part of **digital transformation**.
- 💻 I self-taught **Python** to use for a myriad of both everyday tasks and bigger projects, use **R** for data visualization and Shiny apps, and originally learned how to write html, CSS, and JavaScript to create my personal website.
- 🌱 I am learning about **Dash** to make useful dashboards for my department, **scikit-learn** for machine learning, and **SQL** and **databases** in the context of chemoinformatics.
- 🤖 I enjoy data in the context of **laboratory software and hardware automation** in chemistry, **HTE experimental design**, and **FAIR data ecosystems** to enable synthetic chemists to do their work with less fuss and extra admin.
